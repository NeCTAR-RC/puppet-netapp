<p>NETAPP MANAGEABILITY SDK LICENSE AGREEMENT </p>

<p>This NetApp Manageability Software Development Kit (“SDK”) License Agreement
(“License”) is a legal agreement between You either as an individual or as an
authorized representative of a business entity (hereafter referred to as “You”
and/or “Your”), and NetApp, Inc. (“NetApp”). If you are accessing the SDK
electronically, indicate your acceptance of these terms by selecting the
“Accept” button at the end of this License. By accepting the terms of the
License, You agree to be bound by the terms of the License, which include any
other applicable licenses provided with the SDK. If You do not agree to all of
the terms, select the “Decline” button at the end of this License. </p>

<p><b>1. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT LICENSE GRANT.</b> Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, NetApp grants You a license to:</p>

<p>(i) Internally use the documentation which may include the “Getting Started
Guide,” FAQs, API documentation, and trouble-shooting guidelines (collectively,
the “SDK Documentation”) solely for the purpose of researching, designing,
developing and testing a software application product (the “Licensee
Application”) for use with NetApp products;</p>

<p>(ii) Use, reproduce and distribute the Language Libraries in object code
form (for C/C++, Java, C#, VB.NET and PowerShell only) and source code form
(for Perl, Python and Ruby only) as incorporated into the Licensee Application;
provided, however, that You (A) reproduce and include the copyright notice that
appears in the Language Libraries as provided by NetApp, and (B) distribute the
Licensee Application incorporating the Language Libraries pursuant to terms no
less restrictive than those set forth herein. You shall not modify the Language
Libraries; and</p>

<p>(iii) Use, reproduce, modify and create derivatives of the Sample Code which
may include utilities (the “Sample Derivatives”) and reproduce and distribute
the Sample Derivatives in object code form as incorporated in the Licensee
Application; provided, however, that You (A) reproduce and include the
copyright notice that appears in the Sample Code as provided by NetApp, and (B)
distribute the Licensee Application incorporating the Sample Derivatives
pursuant to terms no less restrictive than those set forth herein. NetApp will
not provide technical support, phone support, or updates to You for the Sample
Code licensed under this License. If NetApp, at its sole option, supplies
updates to You, the updates will be considered part of the Sample Code, and
subject to the terms of this License.</p>

<p>You shall not combine the Language Libraries or the Sample Derivatives into
a Licensee Application such that the Language Libraries or Sample Derivatives
would be licensed under a license that requires the Language Libraries or
Sample Derivatives to be (a) disclosed or distributed in source code form, (b)
licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or (c) redistributable at
no charge. </p>

<p><b>2. SNAPDIFF API LICENSE GRANT.</b> The SDK may also include the NetApp
SnapDiff APIs and accompanying API documentation (collectively, “SnapDiff”),
for which the following license terms apply. NetApp grants You a limited,
terminable, revocable, nonexclusive license, with no right of sublicense, to
implement SnapDiff, in Your Licensee Application, as long as such implementation
does not have the functionality to transfer data from a NetApp storage device
to a non-NetApp disk or solid state storage device.</p>

<p><b>3. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.</b> Notwithstanding other statements in this
License, the SDK may include third party software including free, copyleft and
open source software components (collectively referred to as “Third Party
Software”) that are distributed in compliance with the particular licensing
terms and conditions attributable to the Third Party Software. NetApp provides the
Third Party Software to you “AS IS” without any warranties or indemnities of
any kind. Copyright notices and licensing terms and conditions applicable to
the Third Party Software are available for review with the SDK Documentation at
<a href="http://communities.netapp.com/docs/DOC-1152" target="_blank"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>http://communities.netapp.com/docs/DOC-1152</span></a>,
and are included in a NOTICES file included within the downloaded files. </p>

<p><b>4. RESTRICTIONS.</b> NetApp shall retain all right, title and interest in
and to the SDK and SDK Documentation, and all copies thereof (hereafter
referred to collectively as the “NetApp Software”). Licensee shall not, nor
shall Licensee allow any third party to: (a) decompile, disassemble, decrypt,
extract, or otherwise reverse engineer or attempt to reconstruct, or discover
any source code or underlying ideas, algorithms, or file formats of, or used
in, the Language Libraries by any means whatever; or (b) remove or conceal any
product identification, copyright or other notices contained in or on the
Language Libraries. NetApp, and any relevant third parties, reserve the right
to revise, including bug fixes and/or patches, upgrade or otherwise change or
modify the NetApp Software (&quot;Upgrade&quot;) at anytime. The NetApp
Software is protected by copyrights, one or more U.S. patents issued or
pending, and other applicable laws. Licensee agrees to take all adequate steps
to protect the NetApp Software from unauthorized disclosure or use. </p>

<p><b>5. CONFIDENTIALITY.</b> You acknowledge that the terms of this License,
the APIs, the API documentation, and the source code are proprietary and
confidential information of NetApp (hereafter “Confidential Information”). You
shall not make the Confidential Information available in any form to any person
other than to Your employees or consultants with a need to know and who are
under an obligation of confidentiality not to disclose such Confidential
Information. You shall use the same degree of care to protect the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information as You use to protect Your own
confidential information but in no event shall such degree of care be less than
a reasonable degree of care. Confidential Information shall not include any
information that (a) You can prove was received by You without confidentiality
obligations of any kind prior to the time of disclosure, provided You did not
receive the information from any third party in violation of that party’s
confidentiality obligations, (b) is in the public domain at the time of
disclosure, (c) enters the public domain after the time of disclosure through
no fault of Yours, or (d) is independently developed by You.</p>

<p><b>6. TERMINATION OF LICENSE.</b> This License is effective until
terminated. This License will terminate automatically if You breach any
material provision of this License. Upon termination, Licensee shall
immediately cease all use of the NetApp Software, and return or destroy all
copies of the NetApp Software and all portions thereof and the accompanying
documentation and where requested by NetApp, so certify in writing to NetApp.
Termination is not an exclusive remedy and all other remedies at law or in
equity will be available to NetApp whether or not the License is terminated.
Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 will survive termination of this
License.</p>

at all times, comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, statutes, rules, and
regulations. </p>

<p><b>10. LICENSEE INDEMNITY.</b> Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold
NetApp and its directors, employees subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, successors
and assigns harmless from and against all  claims, damages, fines, assessments,
losses, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising from any third
party claims or government or regulatory actions asserted against NetApp and
its employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns (or which are
otherwise tendered to NetApp by an indemnitee), that are based in whole or in
part on any of the following: (a) Licensee's use or misuse of the NetApp
Software in violation of this License; (b) use of the NetApp Software in
combination with any other software not provided hereunder; (c) Licensee's

infringement of an intellectual property right of a third party arising from or
related to the Licensee Application. </p>

<p><b>11. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.</b> Each party shall comply with all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign laws and ordinances including, but not
